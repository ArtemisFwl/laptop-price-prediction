## Feature Engineering Summary

After cleaning the raw dataset, several meaningful features were engineered to
improve model performance. Screen resolution was parsed into width and height,
and pixel density (PPI) was derived to capture display quality. CPU and GPU
information was simplified into high-level categories to reduce noise, and
storage configurations were converted into binary indicators for SSD and HDD
presence. These engineered features make the dataset more structured and
model-friendly.
